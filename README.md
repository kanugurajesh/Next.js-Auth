# Scalable and reliable authentication using Next.js + Mongodb
Welcome, First of all thanks for showing intrest in my project. Let me give you a brief introduction to the project. This project aims at providing secure, scalable and reliable authentication to the Next.js projects without using any third party services and by only using core tech

## Problem Statement
We generally come across many third party authentication services but the problem with them is that they cost us a lot of money when we expand our product or we share the data with the third party services and there is always a trust issue. And if the service goes down our entire product goes down and setting up another service is a tedious task

## Solution Statement
To tackle the above issue I have developed this project which aims to provide secure, scalable and reliable authentication system at zero or minimum cost based on scaling. I have used the core platforms to reduce costs and increase performance as much as possible. you can use this project as template and build your products on top of it. I would love to take open source contributions to improve the product and help my peers to build the future tech
